### **Adding Styles** | Exercise Description:

The most recommended way to do styles on React is using CSS-in-JS.
Basically you create an object with your styles like this:

```javascript
const mySuperStyles = {
    color: "blue",
    fontSize: "14px",
    border: "1px solid black"
}
```

And then you can apply those styles to your HTML like this:

```html
<div style={mySuperStyles}>I am an alert</div>
```
