### **Listening Events** | Exercise Description:

Events work in react pretty much the same way they do in Vanilla JS: if you want to listen for the user Click, all you have to do is add your `onClick` property (or any other event) to the HTML tag, how it is usually done.

The current code has one component that prints "I was clicked!" to the console.

### 📝 Instructions:
1. Update the component to call it correctly and then check the console.
